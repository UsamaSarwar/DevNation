<h1>Flutter Complete Bootcamp</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Flutter is a cross-platform framework that empowers businesses to develop natively compiled beautiful and productive applications from a single code base by eliminating the need for separate coders for Mobile, Web, Desktop and Embedded Platforms. There are several programming languages and frameworks for building apps, but Flutter is the best out of the rest due to its cross-platform support, efficiency and productivity.

## Dart Programming
> _Programming is an increasingly important skill, whether you aspire to a career in software development or other fields. This season is the first in the specialisation Introduction to Programming in Dart, but its episodes extend to any language you might want to learn like C/C++/C# and Java. This is because programming is fundamentally about figuring out how to solve a class of problems and writing the algorithm, a clear set of steps to solve any problem in its class. This course will introduce you to powerful Object-Oriented Programming in which you can solve any programming problem. In this season, you will learn how to build console-based applications professionally._

## Flutter Development
> _Flutter - a framework developed by Google - allows you to learn one language (Dart) and build beautiful native mobile apps in no time. Flutter is an SDK providing the tooling to compile Dart code into native code and it also gives you a rich set of pre-built and pre-styled UI elements (so-called widgets) which you can use to compose your user interfaces. Flutter is extremely trending and gets used for major Google apps like their Adwords app - it's now marked as "ready for production", hence now is the time to jump in and learn it! This course will teach Flutter from scratch, you certainly don't need any Android or iOS development experience since the whole idea behind Flutter is to only learn one language. You'll learn Flutter not only in theory but we'll build a complete, realistic app throughout this course. This app will feature both the core basics as well as advanced features like using Google Maps, the device camera, adding animations, and more! With Flutter, you'll be able to write code only once and ship your apps both to the Apple AppStore and Google Play. Use Google's Material Design to build beautiful, yet fully customisable, apps in no time with almost zero effort. You can use the rich widget suite Flutter provides to add common UI elements like buttons, switches, forms, toolbars, lists and more - or you simply build your own widgets - Flutter makes that a breeze, too._
